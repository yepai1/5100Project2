"73171","Child labor and a lack of education was one of the other reasons for people wishing to leave their homes","Jacob Lawrence",1940,"Moma",17180

"73179","The Negro was the largest source of labor to be found after all others had been exhausted","Jacob Lawrence",1940,"Moma",17188
"73180","The migrants arrived in great numbers","Jacob Lawrence",1940,"Moma",17189

"73191","And the migrants kept coming","Jacob Lawrence",1940,"Moma",17200
